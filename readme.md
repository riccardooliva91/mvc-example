# Work in progress

This project served as an example for a friend of how to manage db entities with authentication in a 
simple but functional MVC approach. I'll keep this here for educational purposes.
THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED, but there's still something working which you can look at.

## Installation
Use `composer install` to install the autoloader and the tests libraries.

## Main features:
- Simple models
- Swappable DB managers
- Middlewares
- Routing
